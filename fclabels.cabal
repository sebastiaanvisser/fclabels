Synopsis:      First class accessor labels.
Description:   This package provides first class labels that can act as
               bidirectional record fields. The labels can be derived
               automatically using Template Haskell which means you don't have
               to write any boilerplate yourself. The labels are implemented as
               lenses and are fully composable. Labels can be used to /get/,
               /set/ and /modify/ parts of a datatype in a consistent way.
               .
               See "Data.Label" for an introductory explanation.
               .
               Internally lenses are not tied to Haskell functions directly,
               but are implemented as arrows. Arrows allow the lenses to be run
               in custom computational contexts. This approach allows us to
               make partial lenses that point to fields of multi-constructor
               datatypes in an elegant way.
               .
               See the "Data.Label.Maybe" module for the use of partial labels.
               .

               >   - Fixed error in derived code in combination with -XMonoLocalBinds.
               >   - Lowered the priority of =: operator.
               >   - Added the =. operator for modification in state monads.
